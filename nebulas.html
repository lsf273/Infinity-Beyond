                    <p class="padd-bottom">If we translate the Latin word ‘nebula’, it would simply mean ‘cloud’. The nebula 
                    that we are about to talk about, however, is so much more than just a cloud. So what is a nebula? A nebula is an interstellar 
                    cloud in outer space that is made up of dust, hydrogen and helium gas, and plasma. It is formed when portions of the 
                    interstellar medium collapse and clump together due to the gravitational attraction of the particles that 
                    comprise them.</p>
            
                    <p class="padd-bottom">For those who are not aware of this yet, outer space is not really totally a vacuum 
                    (although it may sometimes be approximated as such). Rather, it is made up of gas and dust known collectively 
                    as the interstellar medium or ISM. So, it is this dispersed matter that eventually collapses and forms a nebula.</p>

                    <p class="padd-bottom">When a star dies in a violent, fiery death, it spews its innards out across the sky, 
                    creating an expanding wave of gas and dust known as a supernova nebula. Arguably, the most famous of these 
                    supernova remnants is M1, also called the Crab Nebula, a blob-like patch visible in low-powered binoculars. 
                    Let's take a look at this viewing treasure.</p>
            
                    <p class="padd-bottom">Chinese astronomers watching the sky on July 4, 1054, noted the appearance of a new or 
                    "guest" star just above the southern horn of Taurus. But knowledge of star-fields was not necessary to spot 
                    this surprising visitor — according to records, the bright source was visible during the daytime for 23 days, 
                    shining six times as brightly as Venus. Those well-versed with the night sky would have been able to see it 
                    for 653 days — almost two years — with the naked eye.</p>

                    <p class="padd-bottom">In 1731, British astronomer John Bevis observed a cloudy blob in the sky and added 
                    it to his star atlas. But it wasn't until French astronomer Charles Messier independently observed it 27 years 
                    later that things began to pick up for this stellar remnant.</p>
                    <p>The nebula stretches 10 light-years across, though it continues to expand. It lies approximately 6,300 
                    light-years from Earth, in the constellation of Taurus. M1 can be seen with the naked eye in a dark sky, 
                    but only barely. A pair of binoculars will turn up a dim patch, while more of the identifying features of 
                    the nebula become visible with a low-magnification telescope.</p>

                    Eagle Nebula, a cloud of interstellar gas and dust 7,000 light-years from Earth. Let's take a look at this 
                    intriguing region.</p>
            
                    <p class="padd-bottom">Also known as M16, the Eagle Nebula is a 5.5 million-year-old cloud of molecular 
                    hydrogen gas and dust stretching approximately 70 light years by 55 light years. Inside the nebula, 
                    gravity pulls clouds of gas together to collapse inward. If enough gas is present, nuclear fusion is 
                    ignited in the center, and the compact cloud becomes a shining star. The Eagle Nebula is thought to have 
                    several star-forming regions within it.</p>
            
                    <p>The gas and dust that ultimately collapsed into the sun four billion years ago likely resided in a 
                    structure similar to the Eagle Nebula.</p>

                    and stretch four light-years out into space. Newborn stars outside of the famous Hubble image are responsible

                    of the glow from the pinkish background gas. Known as an emission cloud, the intriguing shape of the nebula is 
                    sculpted by radiation from the stars around it. The dark gas extends below the more obvious horse's head

                    of the famous Orion's Belt in the constellation Orion. The Messier 78 nebula, which is also known as NGC 2068, is 
                    often called the reflection nebula, because its dust particles reflect the starlight that falls on them. These pockets 
                    of dust typically hide more interesting cosmic objects, but the new photo of Messier 78 and its surroundings 
                    demonstrates the beauty of dust particles in space.</p>
            
                    <p class="padd-bottom">In the newly released image, another reflection nebula, called NGC 2071, can be seen at 
                    the top. This nebula contains a massive young star that is estimated to be five times the mass of the sun. This 
                    star is located in the brightest peak seen in the APEX observations, ESO officials said. The lower regions of 
                    the image contain mostly low-mass young stars.</p>

                    <h4>Facts</h4>
                    <p class="padd-bottom">This nebula is primarily a reflection nebula, where there’s very little ionized gas but a 
                    lot of reflected light. The energy of the blue stars are insufficient to ionize much of the gas in the nebula but 
                    is large enough to light up a large fraction of the gas, sending that blue light 1,600 light years across the 
                    galaxy to our eyes. (And yes, the dust is better at reflecting blue light than red light, which is why most dust 
                    is invisible to infrared light!)</p>
                    <p class="padd-bottom">Of course, outside of this nebula, the much more diffuse clouds of gas are sufficiently 
                    ionized to create that characteristic reddish glow, clearly visible in this long-exposure, wide field image of M78.</p>

                    <p class="padd-bottom">The Tarantula Nebula, also known as 30 Doradus and NGC 2070, is a large region of ionized 
                    gas surrounding a collection of newly-forming stars at the eastern end of the stellar bar in the Large Magellanic 
                    Cloud (many similar regions are scattered through the LMC; see Kennicutt et al. 1995, Astronomical Journal, 109, 594). 
                    Hydrogen gas around the hot, young, massive stars is ionized by their ultraviolet radiation and glows as it recombines. </p>
            
                    <p>The same process illuminates the Orion Nebula, even though it is only a hundredth the size of the Tarantula. 
                    Supernova 1987A, which was visible to the naked eye, appeared in this region. Stars which undergo such 
                    explosions live for only a few million years, and thus do not often travel far from their birthplaces.</p>

                    <h4>Facts</h4>
                    <p class="padd-bottom">The Tarantula Nebula has an apparent magnitude of 8. Considering its distance of about 
                    49 kpc (160,000 light-years), this is an extremely luminous non-stellar object. Its luminosity is so great 
                    that if it were as close to Earth as the Orion Nebula, the Tarantula Nebula would cast shadows. In fact, 
                    it is the most active starburst region known in the Local Group of galaxies.</p>
                    <p class="padd-bottom">The estimated mass of the cluster is 450,000 solar masses, suggesting it will likely 
                    become a globular cluster in the future.</p>

                    <h4>Facts</h4>
                    <p class="padd-bottom">In addition to R136, the Tarantula Nebula also contains an older star cluster – 
                    catalogued as Hodge 301 – with an age of 20–25 million years. The most massive stars of this cluster 
                    have already exploded in supernovae.</p>
                    <p class="padd-bottom">Not only does it hold the record for most massive supernova ever recorded, it also is 
                    home to the heaviest star ever found. Between the immense colors and sheer size of the Tarantula Nebula, you can
                    be sure that there are still more interesting things to find in the sector of the cosmos.</p>
