            	<p class="padd-bottom">The word "quasar" refers to a "quasi-stellar radio source." The first quasars were discovered 
                in the 1960s when astronomers measured their very strong radio emissions. Later, scientists discovered that 
                quasars are actually radio-quiet, with very little radio emission. However, quasars are some of the brightest 
                and most distant objects we can see.</p>
        
                <p class="padd-bottom">These ultra-bright objects are likely the centers of active galaxies where supermassive 
                black holes reside. As material spirals into the black holes, a large part of the mass is converted to energy. 
                It is this energy that we see. And though smaller than our solar system, a single quasar can outshine an entire 
                galaxy of a hundred billion stars. To date, astronomers have identified more than a thousand quasars.</p>

                massive Andromeda galaxy, their central black holes will merge to form a supermassive black hole. It is most 
                likely that this black hole will create a quasar, when it starts gobbling matter again.</p>

            	<p class="padd-bottom">A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not 
                get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when 
                a star is dying. Because no light can get out, people can't see black holes. They are invisible. Space telescopes 
                with special tools can help find black holes. The special tools can see how stars that are very close to black holes 
                act differently than other stars.</p>
        
                <p class="padd-bottom">The largest black holes are called "supermassive." These black holes have masses that are 
                more than 1 million suns together. Scientists have found proof that every large galaxy contains a supermassive 
                black hole at its center. The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy is called Sagittarius A.</p>

            	<p class="padd-bottom">In astronomy, stellar classification is a classification of stars based on their spectral 
                characteristics. The spectral class of a star is a designated class of a star describing the ionization of its 
                chromosphere, what atomic excitations are most prominent in the light, giving an objective measure of the 
                temperature in this chromosphere. </p>
        
                <p class="padd-bottom">Light from the star is analyzed by splitting it up by a diffraction grating, 
                subdividing the incoming photons into a spectrum exhibiting a rainbow of colors interspersed by absorption lines, 
                each line indicating a certain ion of a certain chemical element. The presence of a certain chemical element 
                in such an absorption spectrum primarily indicates that the temperature conditions are suitable for a certain 
                excitation of this element.</p>

                and in theory nothing can travel faster than light. In miles per hour, light speed is, well, a lot: about 670,616,629 
                mph. If you could travel at the speed of light, you could go around the Earth 7.5 times in one second.</p>
        
                <p class="padd-bottom">Early scientists, unable to perceive light’s motion, thought it must travel instantaneously. 
                Over time, however, measurements of the motion of these wave-like particles became more and more precise. Thanks 
                to the work of Albert Einstein and others, we now understand light speed to be a theoretical limit: light speed — 
                a constant called "c" — is thought to be not acheivable by anything with mass, for reasons explained below. 
                That doesn’t stop sci-fi writers, and even some very serious scientists, from imagining alternative theories 
                that would allow for some awfully fast trips around the universe.</p>
