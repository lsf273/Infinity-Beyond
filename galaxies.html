                    <p class="padd-bottom">You’ve probably heard that our Sun is located in the Milky Way galaxy. But what is 
                    a galaxy anyway? The simple answer is that a galaxy is a collection of stars held together by their mutual 
                    galaxy. In other words, all the stars in a galaxy are kept together by the gravity of all the other stars 
                    (as well as the invisible, mysterious dark matter).</p>
            
                    <p class="padd-bottom">We know the Milky Way pretty well, so let’s consider it as a good example of a galaxy. 
                    The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy. It has a bright central core with a high density of stars, and then a 
                    flattened disk surrounding it – like a spinning record. Two spiral arms start just outside the core, and 
                    then spiral outward like a pinwheel to the outer edges of the galaxy. The Milky Way measures about 100,000 
                    light-years across, and is thought to contain 200-400 billion stars.</p>

                    Made up of older, dimmer stars, the bulge in the center is thought to contain a supermassive black hole, though 
                    observing it can be a challenge. The dim light from the older stars can make the bulge difficult to pinpoint, 
                    and there are some spirals that lack this characteristic. The supermassive black hole thought to exist at the 
                    center is often blocked by dust and gas surrounding it.</p>

                    <p class="padd-bottom">A barred spiral galaxy is a spiral galaxy with a central bar-shaped structure composed of stars. 
                    Bars are found in approximately two-thirds of all spiral galaxies.Bars generally affect both the motions of 
                    stars and interstellar gas within spiral galaxies and can affect spiral arms as well.</p>
            
                    <p class="padd-bottom">Barred spiral galaxies are apparently predominant, with surveys showing that up to two-thirds 
                    of all spiral galaxies contain a bar.[3] The current hypothesis is that the bar structure acts as a type of stellar 
                    nursery, fueling star birth at their centers. The bar is thought to act as a mechanism that channels gas inwards 
                    from the spiral arms through orbital resonance, in effect funneling the flow to create new stars.[4] This process 
                    is also thought to explain why many barred spiral galaxies have active galactic nuclei, such as that seen in the 
                    Southern Pinwheel Galaxy.</p>

                    structure decaying over time, transforming the galaxy from a barred spiral to a "regular" spiral pattern. Past 
                    a certain size the accumulated mass of the bar compromises the stability of the overall bar structure.</p>

                    Other clusters with hundreds to thousands of galaxies are called rich clusters. The low mass of a poor cluster prevents

                    Elliptical galaxies lack the swirling arms of their more well-known siblings, spiral galaxies. Instead, they bear

                    <p class="padd-bottom">Most galaxies fit one of the three previously described types, but about 3% of the galaxies 
                    we observe are very different. These so-called "irregular galaxies" do not have a lot of common features. Many of 
                    them are the results of galaxy collisions or near misses. One type of irregular galaxy is called a "starburst galaxy." 
                    Starburst galaxies shine brightly as many new stars are born in a short period of time.</p>
            
                    <p class="padd-bottom">Irregular galaxies are usually found in groups or clusters, where collisions and 
                    near-misses between galaxies are common. In a few irregular galaxies, astronomers can't figure out why 
                    they look so strange! They are among the smallest galaxies and are full of gas and dust. Having a lot of gas 
                    and dust means that these galaxies have a lot of star formation going on within them. This can make them 
                    very bright. The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are examples of irregular galaxies.</p>

                    formed by several mechanisms. One of the most common is a gravitational interaction with another nearby galaxy.</p>
