                    and weather. The Sun is an almost perfect sphere with a difference of just 10km in diameter between the poles and the equator. 
                    The average radius of the Sun is 695,508 km (109.2 x that of the Earth) of which 20–25% is the core.</p>
            
                    <p class="padd-bottom">One million Earths could fit inside the Sun:
                    If a hollow Sun was filled up with spherical Earths then around 960,000 would fit inside. On the other hand if these 
                    Earths were squished inside with no wasted space then around 1,300,000 would fit inside. The Sun’s surface area is 11,990 
                    times that of the Earth’s.</p>
            
                    <p>The Sun contains 99.86% of the mass in the Solar System:
                    The mass of the Sun is approximately 330,000 times greater than that of Earth. It is almost three quarters Hydrogen, 
                    whilst most of the remaining mass is Helium.</p>

                    during twilight. For every two orbits of the Sun, Mercury completes three rotations about its axis and up until 1965 
                    it was thought that the same side of Mercury constantly faced the Sun. Thirteen times a century Mercury can be observed 
                    from the Earth passing across the face of the Sun in an event called a transit, the next will occur on the 9th May 2016.</p>
            
                    <p class="padd-bottom">One day on Mercury lasts the equivalent of 176 Earth days. Mercury is nearly tidally locked to 
                    the Sun and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun. </p>

                    Moon. Named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, Venus is the second largest terrestrial planet and is sometimes 
                    referred to as the Earth’s sister planet due the their similar size and mass. The surface of the planet is obscured by an 
                    opaque layer of clouds made up of sulfuric acid.</p>
            
                    <p class="padd-bottom">While its size and mass are similar to Earth, the small asteroids are crushed when entering its 
                    atmosphere, meaning no small craters lie on the surface of the planet. The pressure felt by a human on the surface would 
                    be equivalent to that experienced deep beneath the sea on Earth.</p>

                        from most other planets in our solar system by having no natural satellites.</p>

                    void of space. Earth is made up of complex, interactive systems that are often unpredictable. Air, water, land,

                    and protects us from meteors as well. Satellites have revealed that the upper atmosphere actually swells by day and

                    <p class="padd-bottom">Jupiter's appearance is a tapestry of beautiful colors and atmospheric features. Most 
                    visible clouds are composed of ammonia. Water exists deep below and can sometimes be seen through clear spots 
                    in the clouds. The planet's "stripes" are dark belts and light zones created by strong east-west winds in 
                    Jupiter's upper atmosphere. Within these belts and zones are storm systems that have raged for years. The 
                    Great Red Spot, a giant spinning storm, has been observed for more than 300 years.</p>

                    astronomer Galileo Galilei was the first to gaze at Saturn through a telescope. To his surprise, he saw a pair 
                    of objects on either side of the planet. He sketched them as separate spheres and wrote that Saturn appeared 
                    to be triple-bodied. In 1659, Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, using a more powerful telescope than Galileo's, 
                    proposed that Saturn was surrounded by a thin, flat ring.</p>

                    what are now called the A and B rings. It is now known that the gravitational influence of Saturn's moon Mimas 
                    is responsible for the Cassini Division, which is 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers) wide.</p>

                    dynamic world with some of the brightest clouds in the outer solar system and 11 rings. The first planet 
                    found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel. The

                    Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune.) Its atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with a small 
                    amount of methane and traces of water and ammonia. Uranus gets its blue-green color from methane gas. Sunlight is 
                    reflected from Uranus's cloud tops, which lie beneath a layer of methane gas. As the reflected sunlight passes back 
                    through this layer, the methane gas absorbs the red portion of the light, allowing the blue portion to pass through.

                    Seventeen days later, its largest moon, Triton, was also discovered.</p>
