                    specific mission. Probes are not re-usable and are destroyed or abandoned after they have completed their 
                    missions. Several examples of probes include the Galileo spacecraft, the Voyager spacecraft, the Mariner 
                    spacecraft, and the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity.</p>

                    <p class="padd-bottom">The European Space Agency's Mars Express was designed to study the geology, atmosphere, 
                    surface environment, history of water and potential for life on Mars. It also carried Great Britain's Beagle 2 
                    lander to Mars. The fast-track mission borrowed technology from the failed Mars 96 mission and the Rosetta 
                    comet-chaser mission.</p>
            
                    <p class="padd-bottom">Accomplishments: Mars Express was Europe's first mission to another planet. It 
                    provided subsurface measurements with the first radar instrument ever flown to Mars, and discovered 
                    underground water-ice deposits. It sent back mineralogical evidence for the presence of liquid water throughout 
                    Martian history and studied the density of the Martian crust in detail. The orbiter's unique orbit also has 
                    allowed it to make up-closed studies of Phobos, the larger of Mars' two moons. The mission has been extended 
                    several times.</p>

                    <p class="padd-bottom">Galileo was the first spacecraft to examine Jupiter and its moons for an extended period. It launched 
                    from the payload bay of space shuttle Atlantis in 1989, got some speed boosts by swinging past Earth twice and Venus once, 
                    then arrived at Jupiter at last in 1995. Circling the solar system's most giant planet for eight years, Galileo 
                    beamed back a string of discoveries to Earth despite encountering several mechanical problems.</p>
            
                    <p class="padd-bottom">It discovered evidence of saltwater below the surfaces of three moons â€“ Europa, 
                    Ganymede and Callisto â€“ and also got close to the infamous "pizza moon" Io as its volcanoes belched into 
                    the atmosphere. When Galileo was almost out of fuel, NASA deliberately sent the spacecraft on a suicide plunge 
                    into Jupiter on Sept. 21, 2003. The sacrifice, the agency said, was necessary to protect Europa â€“ which likely 
                    has a subsurface ocean that could contain life.</p>

                    <p class="padd-bottom">Viking 1's Titan III-E rocket roared to life Aug. 20, 1975, as the spacecraft set 
                    forth on its nearly 500-million-mile journey to Mars. Fully fueled, the orbiter-lander duo weighed about 
                    7,800 pounds. Viking 1's twin, Viking 2, went into space on Sept. 9, 1975.</p>

            	<p class="padd-bottom">New Horizons is a NASA spacecraft on its way to the dwarf planet Pluto. It scooted 
                by Jupiter in 2007, and will pass by Pluto in 2015 before possibly heading further into the Kuiper Belt â€“ 
                a massive zone of icy bodies beyond Neptune. When the spacecraft reaches Pluto, it will be only the fifth one 
                to head so far away from Earth (the other ones being Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11, and Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, 
                which now fly in the outer reaches of the solar system).</p>
        
                <p class="padd-bottom">This distance â€” about 3 billion miles (5 billion kilometers) from Earth â€” presented power 
                challenges for New Horizon's designers, since the sun's rays are too weak to generate power. There will 
                also be long communications delays for those staying in touch with the 1,054-pound spacecraft; at Pluto, 
                it will take 4.5 hours for a one-way message to get there from Earth.</p>

            	<h4>Facts</h4>
                <p class="padd-bottom">Spacecraft typically have a set design lifetime, similar to warranties on electronics 
                or cars. Over time, solar particles, cosmic rays and other phenomena can degrade the surface of the spacecraft 
                or mess up the electronics. This makes long missions such as New Horizons especially challenging.</p>

                <p class="padd-bottom">Another question, was how to handle power when the sun is 
                too weak to provide solar power. New Horizons carries nuclear power (more precisely, a radioisotope 
                thermoelectric generator) on board to solve this problem.</p>

                    <p class="padd-bottom">Voyager 1 is one of two probes launched in 1977 to explore the outer planets in 
                    our solar system. The spacecraft and its twin, Voyager 2, made some surprising discoveries and have kept on 
                    going. Voyager 1 is about to become the first manmade object to travel into interstellar space. Voyager 1 was 
                    actually the second of the twin spacecraft to launch, but it was the first to race by Jupiter and Saturn. 
                    The images it sent back have been used in schoolbooks and newspaper outlets for a generation. Also on 
                    board was a special record, carrying voices and music from Earth out into the cosmos.</p>
            
                    <p class="padd-bottom">Voyager 2 launched on Aug. 20, 1977, and Voyager 1 launched about two weeks later, 
                    on Sept. 5. Since then, the spacecraft have been traveling along different flight paths and at different speeds. </p>

                    <p class="padd-bottom">The Voyager missions were intended to take advantage of a special alignment of 
                    the outer planets that happens every 176 years. It would allow a spacecraft to slingshot from one planet 
                    to the next, assisted by the first planet's gravity.</p>
